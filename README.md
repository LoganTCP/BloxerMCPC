# ABANDONED! DO NOT USE BLOXER AT ALL!
Honestly, dont even know why I made this repository... At the time I knew nothing about GitHub or even programming for that matter! ðŸ˜‚ So, I'll be archiving this repository and it will probably never be in production again because there are so many better alternatives out there for this use case... One I really like for a Linux server is [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/)! Go check them out if that sounds like what you are looking for in BloxerMCPC, great server host! Anyways, farewell Bloxer!
